LPTMonitor.NET is a parallel port input/output monitoring tool for Windows.

With LPTMonitor.NET you’ll be able to:

* Monitor the data, status and control registers, pin by pin.
* Turn individual pins on or off.
* Get the decimal value of any register.
* Simultaneously monitor multiple parallel ports (0×278, 0×378, 0x3BC).

Back when I created this app, I needed a simple way to debug the parallel port and couldn’t find a tool to do this in an easy way. That’s why I ended up writing my own.

LPTMonitor.NET is a .NET application written in C# using Windows.Forms.
